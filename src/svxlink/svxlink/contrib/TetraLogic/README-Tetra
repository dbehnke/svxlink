This branch only works if you have the following things:

- Motorola MTM5x00, MTM800E, MTM800FuG
- active data cable, e.g. PMKN4104
- (Sepura/Cleartone my work, but no warranty)

The MS is completely controlled by AT-commands over the PEI interface

Installation instructions from Frédéric/F1IWQ can be found here:

Here are quick-and-dirty installation/update documentation, keep 
in mind: No configuration will be done!

1) first time installation (including German(!) voice announcements):

You may use my semi-automatic installation-script from here 
http://svxlink.ham-radio-op.net/svxlink/svxlink-tetra-contrib.sh

Start installation as root:
wget -O - http://svxlink.ham-radio-op.net/svxlink/svxlink-tetra-contrib.sh | bash

2) alternatively do this:
git clone https://github.com/dl1hrc/svxlink.git
cd svxlink/src
git checkout tetra-contrib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSE_QT=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=/etc -DLOCAL_STATE_DIR=/var -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_CONTRIB_TETRA_LOGIC=ON  ..
make
sudo make install

Please not that the cmake-parameter "-DWITH_CONTRIB_TETRA_LOGIC=ON" enables the
TetraLogic extension. Without this it will not work.


3) Update an existing tetra-contrib installation made by the previous script:

systemctl stop svxlink
cd /home/svxlink/svxlink/src/build/
git pull
sudo make install
sudo systemctl restart svxlink

The new configuration file TetraLogic.conf contains the [TetraLogic]-section
from svxlink.conf. This file is now located in /etc/svxlink/svxlink.d directory.
Remove the [TetraLogic]-section from svxlink.conf but let the LOGICS- and LINKS
definitions with "Tetra" untouched.
