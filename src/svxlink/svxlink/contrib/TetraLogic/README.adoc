== TetraLogic ==
Provides a Logic to connect to Tetra radios like MTM5400/ MTM 800.

This branch only works if you have the following things:

- Motorola MTM5x00, MTM800E, MTM800FuG
- active data cable, e.g. PMKN4104
- (Sepura/Cleartone my work, but no warranty)

The MS is completely controlled by AT-commands over the PEI interface

Installation instructions from Frédéric/F1IWQ can be found here:
https://github.com/f1iwq2/Tetra_Link_boardIWQ/blob/main/Doc/Download%20svxlink-tetra.pdf

Here are quick-and-dirty installation/update documentation, keep in
mind: No configuration will be done!

The configuration of the Tetra part has been moved to this new file,
normally found in /etc/svxlink/svxlink.d

== First time installation ==
including German(!) voice announcements.

You may use my semi-automatic installation-script from here 
```
http://svxlink.ham-radio-op.net/svxlink/svxlink-tetra-contrib.sh
```

Start installation as root:
```
wget -O - http://svxlink.ham-radio-op.net/svxlink/svxlink-tetra-contrib.sh | bash
```

== Installation of SvxLink with TetraLogic extension ==

```
git clone https://github.com/dl1hrc/svxlink.git
cd svxlink/src
git checkout tetra-contrib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSE_QT=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=/etc -DLOCAL_STATE_DIR=/var -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_CONTRIB_TETRA_LOGIC=ON ..
make
# on weak systems make should be used with the "-j4 -l2" options: make -j4 -l2
# tnx to Daniel/SP0DZ
sudo make install
```

Please not that the cmake-parameter "-DWITH_CONTRIB_TETRA_LOGIC=ON" enables the
TetraLogic extension. Without this it will not work.

== Update an existing tetra-contrib ==
```
systemctl stop svxlink
cd /home/svxlink/svxlink/src/build/
make clean
git pull
sudo make install
sudo systemctl restart svxlink
```

The new configuration file TetraLogic.conf contains the [TetraLogic]-section
from svxlink.conf. This file is now located in /etc/svxlink/svxlink.d directory.
Remove the [TetraLogic]-section from svxlink.conf but let the LOGICS- and LINKS
definitions with "Tetra" untouched.

To use the QOS (quality of service) funtionality the installation and configuration
of ssmtp is needed.

== Documentation ==
- manpage svxlink.conf.5
