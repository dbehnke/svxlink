Steps to enable Sip dial-out by sending a Tetra state-SDS:

Look for "SipDialOfromTetra.tcl", configure it to your needs and store it under
/usr/share/svxlink/ebents.d/local

Be sure that you have the valid sipctrl path configured, it must fit to the param
SIP_CTRL_PTY parameter in your svxlink.conf (section [SipLogic]), e.g.

[SipLogic]
SIP_CTRL_PTY=/tmp/sipctrl

In the file "SipDialOfromTetra.tcl" configure the line:

    set port [open "/tmp/sipctrl" w+];


For TetraLogic you have to configure the section [SdsToCommand] like this

[SdsToCommand]
32768=26200553#
32769=555121212#

Define state SDS's in your codeplug of your mobile station, e.g. "Adi DMR+SIP : 32768"

A state SDS 32768 sent to the MTM is initiating a sip call to 26200553, a state sds to
32769 dial out to 555121212 and so on.


With the next updates the configuration will be much easier, I promise ;)
