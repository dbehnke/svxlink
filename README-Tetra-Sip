Steps to enable Sip dial-out by sending a Tetra state-SDS:

Look for "SipDialOfromTetra.tcl", configure it to your needs and store it under
/usr/share/svxlink/ebents.d/local

Be sure that you have the valid sipctrl path configured, it must fit to the param
SIP_CTRL_PTY parameter in your svxlink.conf (section [SipLogic]], e.g.

[SipLogic]
SIP_CTRL_PTY=/tmp/sipctrl

In the file "SipDialOfromTetra.tcl" configure the line:

    set port [open "/tmp/sipctrl" w+];

With the next updates the configuration will be much easier, I promise ;)
